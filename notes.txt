# Project Idea: Recommending Stocks and Bitcoin Based on Social Media Sentiments and Historical Data

=> breakdown of common approaches and resources:

1. Sentiment Analysis of Social Media (e.g., Twitter):
Data Collection:
Projects often involve scraping data from Twitter using the Twitter API, filtering for tweets containing keywords like "Bitcoin" or relevant hashtags. 
Sentiment Analysis:
Libraries like VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) or FinBERT (a transformer-based model for financial sentiment analysis) are used to determine the sentiment of the tweets (positive, negative, neutral). 
Model Building:
The sentiment scores are then incorporated into various machine learning models, such as:
Time Series Models: ARIMA, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for capturing the temporal patterns in price and sentiment data. 
Regression Models: Linear regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) are used to predict the price. 
Evaluation:
Metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the model's performance. 

2. Sentiment Analysis of News Articles:
Data Collection:
Projects may involve scraping news articles from financial news websites or using APIs provided by news aggregators. 
Sentiment Analysis:
Similar to social media analysis, NLP techniques and pre-trained models like FinBERT are used to determine the sentiment of the news articles. 
Model Building:
The sentiment scores from news articles are used as features in predictive models, often combined with other data like historical price data or technical indicators. 

3. Combining Sentiment with Other Factors:
Blockchain Data:
Some projects incorporate data from the Bitcoin blockchain, such as transaction volume, number of active addresses, or hash rate. 
Technical Indicators:
Technical indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index) and SMA (Simple Moving Average) can be used in conjunction with sentiment data.

=> Basic Pipeline
1. Data Collection
- Twitter[Tweepy] or Reddit[PRAW] API for sentiments 
- Kaggle or other source for sentiments and price data 
- other reliable source
- keywords: “Bitcoin,” “BTC,”, #Bitcoin, #StockMarket., r/Bitcoin, r/WallStreetBets[reddit]

2. Preprocessing
- Text Data (Tweets/Posts):
    Remove noise: URLs, special characters, emojis using regex.
    Tokenize and lemmatize text with NLTK or spaCy for sentiment analysis.
    Calculate sentiment scores using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a rule-based sentiment analysis tool optimized for social media. VADER outputs positive, negative, and neutral scores per tweet.
    Aggregate sentiment by time interval (e.g., daily) to align with price data.
- Price Data:
    Convert timestamps to a consistent format (e.g., UTC).
    Handle missing values by interpolation or forward/backward fill.
    Create target variable: Classify price movement as “up” (close > open), “down” (close < open), or “neutral” (close ≈ open) for recommendation.
- Merging:
    Align datasets by timestamp to create a unified dataset with features (sentiment scores, price, volume) and target (price movement class).
- Output: A clean CSV file with columns like timestamp, sentiment_score, price_open, price_close, volume, movement_class.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
- Techniques:
    - Visualizations:
        Plot time series of Bitcoin/stock prices and sentiment scores to identify trends or correlations.
        Use box plots to compare sentiment scores across price movement classes (up, down, neutral).
        Create scatter plots to explore relationships between sentiment and price changes.
    - Statistical Analysis:
        Compute correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson) between sentiment scores and price movements.
        Analyze summary statistics (mean, median, variance) of sentiment and price data.
        Test for stationarity in price data using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to inform model choice.
- Tools: Python libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, statsmodels.
- Expected Insights:
    Identify if positive sentiment correlates with price increases, as suggested by prior studies.
    Detect outliers (e.g., extreme sentiment spikes due to influencer tweets).
    Understand data imbalances (e.g., more positive than negative tweets).

4. Algorithms and Calculations
- Choosing recommendation algorithm -> content-based recommendation system
    This approach uses features (sentiment scores, price trends, volume) to classify assets as “good,” “poor,” or “neutral” and recommends based on predicted performance.
- Data mining techniques/models to test`
    Random Forest (RF): Robust to overfitting and effective for financial data.
    Support Vector Machine (SVM): Suitable for high-dimensional data.
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Captures temporal dependencies in time series.
- Features: Sentiment scores, price open/close, volume, lagged price changes.
- Recommendation Logic:
    Classify each asset’s predicted movement.
    Recommend “good” assets (predicted “up”) to clients, flag “poor” assets (predicted “down”) for avoidance, and note “neutral” assets for monitoring.
    Rank recommendations by confidence scores (e.g., model probability for “up” class).

5. Evaluation
- Evaluation Metrics:
    - Classification Metrics:
        Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
        Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Assess performance per class (up, down, neutral), especially important for imbalanced data.
        Confusion Matrix: Visualize prediction errors across classes.
    - Financial Metrics:
        Simulate a trading strategy (e.g., buy “good,” sell “poor”) and calculate return on investment (ROI) or Sharpe ratio to assess practical utility.
    - ROC Curve: Evaluate model discrimination ability for binary classification (e.g., up vs. not-up).
- Validation:
    Use time-series cross-validation to ensure temporal integrity.
    Compare model performance across different feature sets and algorithms.
- Expected Results:
    Prior studies report accuracies of 70–75% for sentiment-based Bitcoin predictions. Aim for similar or better performance with robust feature engineering.

-> technical indicators in stock market that are used to identify whether the stock is good/bad/neutral
1. Trend Indicators
These help identify the direction and strength of a price trend.
Moving Averages (MA)
    Simple Moving Average (SMA) – Average price over a period (e.g., 50-day, 200-day).
    Exponential Moving Average (EMA) – Gives more weight to recent prices (faster reaction).
    Interpretation:
        Bullish: Price > MA (especially 50 > 200 = "Golden Cross")
        Bearish: Price < MA (50 < 200 = "Death Cross")

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
    Compares two EMAs (typically 12-day and 26-day) with a signal line (9-day EMA).
    Interpretation:
        Bullish: MACD line crosses above signal line.
        Bearish: MACD line crosses below signal line.

2. Momentum Indicators
Measure the speed and strength of price movements.
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    Measures overbought/oversold conditions (0-100 scale).
    Interpretation:
        Overbought (Bearish): RSI > 70
        Oversold (Bullish): RSI < 30
        Neutral: RSI between 30-70
Stochastic Oscillator
    Compares closing price to its price range over a period.
    Interpretation:
        Bullish: %K crosses above %D (below 20 = oversold).
        Bearish: %K crosses below %D (above 80 = overbought).

3. Volatility Indicators
Show how much a stock’s price fluctuates.
Bollinger Bands
    SMA with upper/lower bands (2 standard deviations away).
    Interpretation:
        Bullish: Price touches lower band (potential bounce).
        Bearish: Price touches upper band (potential pullback).
        Neutral: Price moves within bands.
Average True Range (ATR)
    Measures volatility (higher ATR = more volatility).
    Helps in setting stop-loss levels.

4. Volume Indicators
Track trading activity to confirm trends.
On-Balance Volume (OBV)
    Adds volume on up days, subtracts on down days.
    Interpretation:
        Bullish: Rising OBV confirms uptrend.
        Bearish: Falling OBV confirms downtrend.
Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
    Average price weighted by volume (used by institutional traders).
    Interpretation:
        Bullish: Price > VWAP.
        Bearish: Price < VWAP.

5. Support & Resistance Indicators
Identify key price levels.
Pivot Points
    Calculated from previous day’s high, low, and close.
    Interpretation:
        Bullish: Price above pivot point.
        Bearish: Price below pivot point.

How to Combine Indicators for Stock Recommendation
Good (Buy Signal):
    Price > 200-day SMA + RSI > 30 (but < 70) + MACD bullish crossover.
Bad (Sell Signal):
    Price < 50-day SMA + RSI > 70 + MACD bearish crossover.
Neutral (Hold):
    Price between key moving averages + RSI in mid-range.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtk8k8G-_3k]


Stochastic Oscillator:
    %K (fast line) and %D (slow line)
    Automatic signal generation:
        Bullish when %K crosses above %D below 20
        Bearish when %K crosses below %D above 80
Enhanced RSI:
    Added explicit signal column:
        Overbought (>70)
        Oversold (<30)
        Neutral (30-70)
Bollinger Bands:
    Added band width calculation
Signal detection:
    Price at lower band → Bullish bounce potential
    Price at upper band → Bearish pullback potential

Average True Range (ATR):
    Pure volatility measure
    Useful for setting stop-loss levels (typically 2xATR)
