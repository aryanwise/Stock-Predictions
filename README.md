# Stock Analysis & Recommendation Dashboard

> Developed By: Aryan Mishra

A **Streamlit-based dashboard** for comprehensive stock analysis, technical indicators, and sentiment-driven recommendations.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the dashboard locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/aryanwise/Stock-Predictions.git"
cd Stock-Predictions
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create one in the root of the repository:

```bash
python -m venv project_env
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

**On macOS / Linux:**

```bash
source project_env/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**

```bash
.\project_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not need the project or dependency you can uninstalle the required packages using:

```bash
pip uninstall -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Dashboard

Navigate into the `Main` directory and run the Streamlit application:

```bash
cd Main
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

This will open the **Stock Analysis & Recommendation Dashboard** in your default web browser.
